[Curriculum Vitae](/cv)

I am a first-year computer science undergraduate seeking experience in software engineering. During my courses, I have tailored an empowering work ethic to understand and implement my learning in different situations. This is achieved through academic coursework and projects while utilising my time-management under pressure. I am looking forward to entering demanding environments to grow my programming expertise to prepare me for the workplace.
